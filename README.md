#  Requirements Engineering â€“ Case Studies

This repository was created to reinforce the theoretical knowledge I gained during the **Requirements Engineering** course in the Spring 2024 semester through practical case studies.

##  Purpose

The focus of this work is on the **requirements gathering phase**, which is one of the most critical steps before starting the actual coding in a software project. In this process, I applied the following steps through case studies:

- Creating scenario definitions  
- Conducting requirements analysis  
- Producing documentation  
- Drawing requirements diagrams

##  Contents

Each case study is organized into a separate folder in this repository. Each folder includes:

-  **Scenario Description**  
-  **Functional and Non-Functional Requirements**  
-  **Requirements Analysis Documents**  
-  **User Stories / Requirements Diagrams (UML, Use Case, etc.)**

##  Highlighted Work

The **Train Control System** case study is a project I originally completed on paper last year. This year, I transformed it into a detailed digital documentation. This project helped me understand the importance of proper requirements analysis in complex systems.

##  What I Gained

Through these case studies, I:

- Learned how to approach the planning and analysis phases in software development  
- Realized how significantly well-defined requirements impact the development process  
- Experienced how requirements engineering directly contributes to system success
